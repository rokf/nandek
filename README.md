Nandek is a **Discord** bot written on the **Luvit** platform.

He is a local *celebrity* sampled from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxDutsdNShQ&t=2s).

Create a `config.lua` file in the root folder and add this content:

```
return {
  token = "YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE"
}
```

Run him with `luvit bot.lua` and spawn into your voice channel with `!nandek`.
The command `!komande` will list all available voice related commands.
